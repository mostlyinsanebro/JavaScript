// DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a structured representation of HTML documents
// and it allows JS to access HTML elements and styles in order to manipulate them.

// We will be able to change text, HTML attributes and even CSS styling with the help of DOM.

// It is basically a connection point between js and the HTML documents and it enables us
// to make changes to HTML document through js code.

// DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as an HTML page loads in it
// and it is stored in a tree structure where each element has one node and nodes
// has child nodes.

// For each element in HTML document there is an element node in the DOM tree using which
// we can interact with this element through js.

// Document is an object in js which serves as an entry point to the DOM because we need to
// select elements in HTML through js code methods like querySelector() are the methods of this object.

// Whatever is there in an HTML Document, is also there in DOM.
// So, DOM is the complete representation of an HTML document.

// DOM !== JAVASCRIPT
// The DOM and DOM methods are part of Web APIs and not js.

// APIs are libraries that Browsers implement and have the DOM and DOM methods as a part of them
// They can be accessed with our js code.

// They are automatically available for us to use.
