// Difference between website and web application

// A website is a collection of web pages and the content is basically 
// static and it does not interact with your device necessarily.


// A web application is also a kind of website but it has much more functionality
// can interact with the browser, can interact with the device, and is more complex to build.

// JavaScript can do various things ->
// 1. It can be used to interact with the browser in order to create interactive web applications.

// 2. It can also be used to create web applications that run on web servers outside of the web browser.
// Node.js is used for this purpose.

// 3. It can also be used to create desktop applications with the help of react native, ionic, and tools like Electron.

// 4. It can also be used to create mobile applications.

// JavaScript Releases:-

// There are new updates to JS with minor updates to es6 every single year.

// ES == ECMAScript
